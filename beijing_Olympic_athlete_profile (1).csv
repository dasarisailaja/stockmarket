The honour was established in 1923 by the Republic of San Marino to recognize foreign nationals who contributed outstanding civil or military services to the Republic, or for humanitarian, artistic, political, or sporting accomplishments.“Receiving this award makes me really proud. It was a clear sign of destiny that I received this particular reward exactly one month after the Milano-Cortina 2026 Olympic Games election. I was at the forefront of the Italian delegation in Lausanne, and it is curious and interesting how, even today, I find myself in a political context linked to sport. I’ve never been to San Marino, and I didn’t know the region so I want to thank the San Marino Federation and the Council of State for this invitation.
